  "b2873": "With years of practical body shop design experience, our Facility Planner has designed hundreds of shops ranging in sizes from 2,000sf to over 60,000sf. Over the years, our specialist has obtained great insight from her clients as to what works and what does not. She had observed many existing conditions where clients have come to her after they'd made costly mistakes, often as a result of designs created by parties offering free shop layouts, with little or no formal training either in architecture or body shop design. Having earned a Bachelor's degree in Architecture and worked in the architectural field for many years, coordinating many projects with architects, builders, engineers and equipment vendors throughout the country, our Facility Planner strives to provide clients with realistic solutions and practical designs.",
  "b2874": "When asked what sets this design service apart from others, our Facility Planner states, <I>\"Rather than telling clients where they could place a new spray booth and providing shop layout of only the Paint Department for instance, I would provide a much more comprehensive plan of the whole facility. My reasoning is that in order to place the spray booth where it would achieve maximum efficiency and flow throughout the whole shop, one must understand the whole picture first. This means taking into consideration what the client wants to achieve in sales and what existing conditions we have to work with. Once the goals and restrictions are made clear, it is possible then to locate where best to place the booth. This kind of careful assessment and planning, combined with my professional experience in the building trade, is what sets this service apart from others.\"</I>",
  "b2875": "There are many elements to consider when looking at the whole picture. For example, in existing building remodels, there are local building code requirements to meet and existing non-movable equipment or structure to consider. For new building construction projects, lot size and shape or slope may restrict the size and shape of the building, while wind direction, severe weather conditions or street frontage may play key factors in the design. If there is room for addition later on, planning ahead could minimize costly relocation of major equipment. All this and more are taken into consideration at the planning stage. Based on all this, it's important to take advantage of VisionPLUS Facility Planning as early on in the planning process as possible. Planning things on paper takes considerably less time and money than to change things later on down the road.",
  "b2876": "The final custom designed presentation drawing developed through our service would be a scaleable floor plan for others in the building trade to work from. Using one of the most widely used computer aided drafting software in the trade, communication is easily sent electronically to architects, builders, engineers and equipment vendors to ensure fast and accurate transmission of information, anywhere in the country.",

  "b9201": "S/Administration/Beside the core processes, in order to ensure that the repairs can be done smoothly, a proper administration is required.",
  "b9202": "S/Health & Safety/Running a Bodyshop is correlated with specific risks, especially chemical ones. Therefore it is essential that each employee wears the appropriate safety equipments and follows the corresponding processes.",
  "b9203": "S/Customer Data/",
  "b9204": "S/Operational Data/Techniques, standard, legal requirements are evolving. Therefore it is necessary to keep the Bodyshop operational documents up to date.",
  "b9205": "S/Business Data/Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are pratical tools to help you get a compact overview of your business. In order to evaluate the rooms for improvement and undergo the corresponding corrective actions, it is essential to collect your business data and summarize them in the form of KPIs.",
  "b9206": "S/Standard Repair Process/Each repair is different. Nevertheless, all repairs share standard processes that may differ in exceptional cases (Aluminium, Spot Repairs…etc). In this section we will look closer to your standard repair process.",
  "b9207": "S/Pretreatment/Before starting with the preparation of the vehicle, cleaning tasks and checking the presence of relevant equipments is necessary.",
  "b9208": "S/Cleaning/It is crucial to clean the vehicule before starting the preparation work. This will enable the Bodyshop to avoid pollution risks and to guarantee a sustainable repair quality. Note that as an average 60% of the complaints are due to insufficient or improper cleaning.",
  "b9209": "S/Pre-Repair Check/",
  "b9210": "S/Preparation/In the paintshop more than 50% of the repair time is spent on preparing the vehicules. The reason is that the preparation process with ist 3 elements, the masking, sanding and drying,  has a huge impact on the outcome of the repair.",
  "b9211": "S/Sanding/Should you not have yet installed a dry sanding system, a comparative analysis will allow to show the advantages. Wet sanding may be recommended where certain repair result is targeted, whereby in most standard cases, dry sanding will prove to be the optimal system.",
  "b9212": "S/Masking/Masking with a tape is the most rational and economical solution for the paintshop. In many cases, combining paper and foil will allow you to obtain an optimal result in terms of time and cost efficiency.",
  "b9213": "S/Drying/By air drying will the filler dry from outside through to inside. With an IR device, it will be dried from inside through to outside with an higher temperature and intensity. The advantage is with IR that it is quicker and with a better sandability and less paper consumption.",
  "b9214": "S/Painting/Once the vehicule has been prepared, it may be painted. We consider the painting process as color finding, paint mixing and spraying. Each process step should error free for a high quality repair.",
  "b9215": "S/Colour Finding/A good colour finding process allows to reduce searching time and to avoid the re-works due to colour issues. Therefore it is crucial to ensure the stability of your colour finding process.",
  "b9216": "S/Paint Mixing/A good paint mixing process allows to reduce mixing time, material consumption and to avoid the re-works due to colour issues. Therefore it is crucial to ensure the stability of your paint mixing process.",
  "b9217": "S/Spraying/A good spraying process allows to reduce application time, material consumption and to avoid the re-works due to colour issues. Therefore it is crucial to ensure the stability of your spraying process.",
  "b9218": "S/Finishing/Finishing is the tip of the Iceberg. This is what enables the customers to see the hardwork performed upfront. Therefore it should not be neglected.",
  "b9219": "S/Repair Equipment/Having a well equiped bodyshop will enable your employees to avoid time costly searching tasks. Looking for tools, products or other repair related products may have a major impact on your efficiency.",
  "b9220": "S/Preparation Equipment/Each preparation bay should be well equiped. One major tool which is a must have for the preparation bays are trolleys.",
  "b9221": "S/Mixing Equipment/Paint mixing is a crucial task as most of the time, complaints are color related. In order to avoid these complaints, the starting point is to ensure a well equiped paint mixing room.",
  "b9222": "S/Spraying Equipment/Spraying is the main core process of the paintshop, therefore in order to ensure high quality of the Paint core process, you should ensure that spraying equipments are available and functionning correctly.",
  "b9223": "S/Infrastructure/The best run bodyshops have good infrastructures. We do not limit infrastructure to material resouces, we expand it to human resources as they are at the heart of the repair process.",
  "b9224": "S/Stock Rooms/The storage, especially the paint storage is very often an important investment for the Bodyshop. Ist proper maintenance is often the result guarantee with respect to economical and quality targets. A past due tinting base can also lead to a re-work…",
  "b9225": "S/Spray booth and oven/The spraybooth is a must for any bodyshop. Therefore, it should not be neglected.",
  "b9226": "S/Overview/You should make sure to keep and maintain your spraybooth at a standard level of quality. This contributes to the quality of the repairs as well.",
  "b9227": "S/Measurements/You should make sure to keep and maintain your spraybooth at a standard level of quality. This contributes to the quality of the repairs as well.",
  "b9228": "S/Compressor/Should one of the 3 compressed air criteria not be met, this may lead to finishing issues. In fact not having a constant and sufficient pression, a sufficient volume and an air of good quality would lead to phenomena such as silicon traces, matting, uneven surface...etc",
  "b9229": "S/Staff/A well trained team will ensure quality of work and productivity for your bodyshop.",
  "b9230": "S/Special Repair Process/Beside the standard processes, you may have to use specialized processes to satisfy your customers. It is even more crucial to comply to proved standards in order to ensure the quality of work, as such processes run in most cases rarely.",
  "b9231": "S/Aluminium Repair/Especially the preparation of aluminium surfaces is difficult and needs an isolated and dedicated working bay. Using the conventional tools for both aluminium and non aluminium would cause corrosion of the surfaces by simple contact.",
  "b9232": "S/Spot Repair/Should you be repairing lots of vehicules with minor damages, with a diameter inferior to 3 cm, you have probably implemented a fast repair process. To ensure productivity and efficiency, it has to follow a standard. ",
